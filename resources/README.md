# Description

The downloaded PDF file will be moved to this *resources* directory within this project structure, where the file will first be removed if it already exists.

The **ImageTester** will be used to verify the all PDF files inside the *resources* directory are as per expectation by either asserting on the pdf or compare it to some existing baseline.
